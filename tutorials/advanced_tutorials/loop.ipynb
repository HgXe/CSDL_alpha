In some cases, CSDL loops can replace manually vectorized code while maintaining similar performance. In addition to easing implementation, this results in more readable code, and is the recommended approach.\n",

    "As can be seen in this example, the CSDL loop is used in the same way as a normal for loop, but with the `csdl.frange` function used to generate the range of values to iterate over. While it looks like the full range is being iterated over, the loop is actually unrolled by the backend, and CSDL only stores a graph representing a single iteration of the loop. This means that the memory and time complexity of the loop is O(1) with respect to the number of iterations, and the loop can be used with very large ranges.\n",

    "## Loop Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "While CSDL loops can be used in many cases, there are some requirements that must be met for the loop to be valid. In short, because CSDL represents the loop using the graph of a single iteration, this graph cannot change between iterations, and everything done within the loop must be representable by the graph. This can be ensured by following these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The loop must consist of only CSDL operations and CSDL variable creations.\n",
    "- The loop must not contain any conditional statements.\n",
    "- Variable setting and getting can depend on the loop index, but slices must be constant size.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "CSDL does not currently allow slices using the loop index, so lists must be used instead. This is a limitation of the current implementation, and may be fixed in the future.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If these requirements are met, the loop can be used in place of a normal for loop, and will be compiled to a more efficient form. The first rule specifically may mean that some loops may need to be rewritten to use CSDL loops, but this can usually be accomplished by breaking the loop into two loops, one standard loop for non-CSDL operations, and one CSDL loop for CSDL operations. The following example demonstrates this in the context of assembling a sparse matrix. Constructing the row and column indices of the matrix is done with a standard loop, while the data is assembled with a CSDL loop.\n",
