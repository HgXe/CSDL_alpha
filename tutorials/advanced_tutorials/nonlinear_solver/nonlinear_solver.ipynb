    "# Nonlinear Solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, our examples have been focused on defining explicit mathematical relationships of the form $y = f(x)$. CSDL also provides an interface to define implicit relationships between variables of the form $f(x,y) = 0$ where $x$ represents parameters (inputs) and $y$ represents states (outputs). Iterative numerical methods (nonlinear solvers) are often used to solve for $y$ given $x$ by perturbing the values of $y$ to drive $r = f(x,y)$ to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show you how to specify this using CSDL's ImplicitVariable and nonlinear solver library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a simple nonlinear system of equations as our example (from https://engcourses-uofa.ca/books/numericalanalysis/nonlinear-systems-of-equations/fixed-point-iteration-method/):\n",
    "\n",
    "$2a = {x_1}^2 + {x_1}{x_2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$57 = {x_2}+3{x_1}{x_2}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is a parameter and $x_1$, $x_2$ are the states. We can rewrite this in the form $r = f(x, y)$:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$r_1 = {x_1}-\\sqrt{a-{x_1}{x_2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_2 = {x_2}-\\sqrt{\\frac{57-{x_2}}{3{x_1}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_1$ and $r_2$ represents the residuals to drive to zero. In order to define this implicit relationship in CSDL, we start by initializing our state variables using CSDL's ImplicitVariable class and the parameter 'a' can  be initialized like any standard CSDL variable. We then compute the residuals explicitly from the state variables and parameters using CSDL operations."
