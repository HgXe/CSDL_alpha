# Loops

CSDL contains a custom iterable for use in for loops that can accelerate compilation of CSDL code, use less memory, and give better run-time performance.
In some cases, CSDL loops can replace manually vectorized code while mainaining similar performance.
In addition to easing implementation, this results in more readable code, and is the reccomended approach.
